*[The Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System)*
are de facto standard for building C/C++ code in the Linux world.
It is a very flexible build system, but because of its flexibility it has
a quite steep learning curve. Here is the bare minimum example that will get
you started.

The bare minimum
----------------
To build a simple hello world program with
[Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System) you just need
3 files. Here is the file structure:
```
bare-minimum-example
├── Makefile.am
├── configure.ac
└── main.c
```
The `configure` will be created from `configure.ac`.
```py
#configure.ac
AC_INIT([hello-world], 1.0)
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign])

AC_PROG_CC
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])

AC_OUTPUT
```
And a `Makefile.am` to generate a `Makefile.in` from which the final `Makefile`
will be created.
```py
#Makefile.am
bin_PROGRAMS = hello
hello_SOURCES = hello.c
```


Contents of `hello.c`:
```cpp
//hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Building
--------
First you need to transform your `configure.ac` into a `configure` script. This is
done by the `autoconf`. The `configure` script uses a `Makefile.in` to produce the
final `Makefile`. The `Makefile.in` is usually generated by the `automake` from
a `Makefile.am`. Are you still with me?

```
configure.ac -> |autoconf| ->  configure  -> |           |
                                             |./configure| -> Makefile
 Makefile.am -> |automake| -> Makefile.in -> |           |
```

You can use `autoreconf` to run `autoconf` and `automake` for you.

```console
$ autoreconf -vfi
```

Then you can run the produced `./configure` script and build you application.
```console
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./hello
Hello world!
```
And that's pretty much it.

Next steps
----------
This example is everything you need to know in order to build a simple program with [Autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System)
. If your scenario is more complex, then with the help of the official [documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)
you will be able extend it.
